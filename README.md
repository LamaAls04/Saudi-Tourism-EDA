# Saudi Arabia Tourism EDA (2015â€“2024)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project explores Saudi Arabiaâ€™s tourism data (2015â€“2024) using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).  
The analysis covers **tourist numbers, spending patterns, inbound vs domestic differences, and provincial trends**.  
The goal is to extract actionable insights supporting Saudi Arabiaâ€™s Vision 2030 tourism strategy.  

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- Tourism dropped sharply in 2020 due to COVID-19, then rebounded strongly by 2024.
- Makkah dominates tourism, while Riyadh and Eastern Region follow.
- Domestic trips dominate in volume, but inbound trips generate higher spending per trip.
- Provinces like Jouf and Najran attract fewer tourists but show high per-trip spending (niche premium markets).

  ## ðŸ“Š Key Visualizations

![Tourists Over Time](images/tourists_over_time.png)

## ðŸš€ Conclusion
Saudi Arabiaâ€™s tourism sector shows strong recovery post-COVID, with domestic resilience and high-value inbound growth.  
The findings can guide policymakers and businesses in expanding tourism offerings across provinces.
